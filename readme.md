## I know nothing about the web
Therefore, I'm trying to get better. Standing up a little toy app with HTMX/Flask because I don't know either

## Shoutout to the Legend
https://github.com/edmondchuc/flask-htmx
https://flask-htmx.readthedocs.io/en/latest

## Runnin'
From the root of the project, spin up a virtual enviroment, activate it, and install some goodies
1. `python3 -m venv .venv`
1. `. .venv/bin/activate`
1. `pip install Flask`
1. `pip install flask-htmx`

Going to keep this to a real minimum of deps. Once you got all that installed and cookin, you can run the app this like:
1. `flask run`

It'll serve the HTML with the local copy of HTMX. Live it. Breathe It. Rejoice.

Power down the server and tear it down when you're done
1. `deactivate`

Rejoice

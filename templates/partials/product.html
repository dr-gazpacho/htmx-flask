<!-- 
    More of a to-do here:
    I'm going to make a whole ass template in shelf that will have three separate HTML blocks for each of the product types
    Is there a way to even templatize those HTML elements?
    Like have the shelf return shells, those shells in turn have some get_on_element_load logic
    that requests specific product type templates/data

    Anyways, hardcoded for now but going to try to explore more later
